      <description>This is what we’ll be making!
 If you can’t see anything then your device doesn’t support canvas. You can still follow along, but it’ll be more fun if you can see your work.
Canvas is a super fun way to create animations on the browser! It’s also very easy to get started.
To make it even easier to start, use CodePen to write your code. I’ll be sharing CodePen examples along the way.</description>

      <description>“If builders built buildings the way programmers wrote programs, then the first woodpecker that came along would destroy civilization.” ~Gerald Weinberg
 I love testing. Quite early in my journey of learning to code, I heard of this “Test Driven Development” thing. Around the same time I was starting to expand the scope of my projects, and was running into very tricky bugs. Sometimes things that worked stopped working and I had no idea why.</description>
